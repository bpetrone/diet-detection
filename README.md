# diet-detection

This repository contains data and code to reproduce figures presented in the manuscript **"A pilot study of metaproteomics and DNA metabarcoding as tools to assess dietary intake in humans."**

Cloning the repository and knitting each R notebook will reproduce the figures in its filename from the inputs in the `data` folder.  The protein and DNA reference databases are also supplied in the `data` folder for independent use.
